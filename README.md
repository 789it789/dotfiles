# My Archlinux Configs

This repository contains my Arch Linux Hyprland rice configuration as well as scripts to transform an arch system to a copy of mine.

## Scripts
- `scripts/pull-configs.sh` pull configs to repo directory
- `scripts/apply-configs.sh` applies the rice.
- `scripts/pacman-install.sh` install necessary packages.
- `scripts/hyprpm.sh` applies the necessary hyprland plugins
Installing the packages, enabling the plugins, and applying the configs should be sufficient to apply 90% of my rice.
